      <h1>How Comic Books Turned a Fan into a Professional, and Educated Him Along the Way</h1>
      <img src="./images/TeenTitansLN-jumbo.jpg" alt="The New Teen Titans">
      <p class="image-desc">The series that cemented George Gene Gustines as a comic book fan.</p>
      <p>As part of the Learning Network’s collection about teaching with comics and graphic novels, we asked George
        Gene
        Gustines, The Times’s reporter on the comic-book industry, to tell us about his job. </p>
      <p>Though he writes about comics on the side of his full-time role, which involves managing budgets and logistics
        for Times graphics and video, any fan will recognize that being paid to read comics in any capacity is almost a
        superpower in itself. </p>
      <p>Below, Mr. Gustines writes about growing up with a comic-book habit he had to keep secret, how a few “lucky
        breaks” led to his beat at The Times — and what immersing oneself in these characters and their worlds can teach
        us about ourselves.</p>
      <p>Teachers: We have posed a related Student Opinion question, “What Have You Learned From Comics?, and we’d love
        to
        hear from your class.</p>
      <h2>How Comic Books Turned a Fan into a Professional, and Educated Him Along the Way</h2>
      <img src="./images/JusticeLeagueLN-jumbo.jpg" alt="Justice League">
      <p class="image-desc">Mr. Gustines’s first comic: Justice League of America, No. 200.</p>
      <p>Comic books have been very, very good to me.</p>
      <p>My first comic was Justice League of America No. 200, which one of my sisters, Elena, randomly bought for me
        back
        in December 1981 at a neighborhood newsstand. That 72-page issue was crammed with an assemblage of heroes
        (Aquaman, Hawkgirl, Martian Manhunter and many more) that blew the socks off my 10-year-old self. It introduced
        me
        to the work of the writer Gerry Conway and the artist George Pérez, though I learned both names only later,
        since
        I was too naïve at the time to read credit boxes.</p>
      <p>It was love at first sight. But I wish I had Batgirl’s “eidetic memory,” a term I learned from comics, because
        I
        cannot now fully recollect how I leapt from those pages to my next obsession, The New Teen Titans.</p>
      <p>That series, written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Mr. Pérez, cemented me as a fan. The two creators crafted a
        grand soap opera with characters who felt very human: Changeling was insecure; Raven had daddy issues; Kid Flash
        debated heroism versus college; Robin and Starfire struggled with whether they could be teammates and romantic
        partners; and more. (I could relate to the insecurity and father issues.)</p>
      <p>The Titans made me an eager reader, counting down the time between monthly installments. My love for them
        encouraged me to write letters to the editors of comics, which were sometimes printed with my address (and
        sparked
        a handful of pen pals).</p>
      <p>One of those letters led me to TitanTalk, an amateur press association. It was a labor of love by and for fans,
        who would make copies of their commentary, stories or original artwork and send them to a central mailer, who
        would collate everything and mail the submissions to each member. I joined that group around 1987, made friends
        I
        still have and got to meet Mr. Pérez, one of the nicest creators in comics, when I was still a teenager.</p>
      <p>All of this, I should add, was fairly secret.</p>
      <p>Growing up as a fan of comics equaled being a nerd. This was long before today’s renaissance when comic book
        characters, particularly superheroes, dominate television and the box office. My family was poor, so my mother
        was
        horrified that I wasted money on comics. I would like to make the argument that this was my way of assimilating
        —
        my parents are from Ecuador and moved here in 1966 — but I suspect they would’ve been happier at the time if I
        had
        any interest in sports (or girls).</p>
      <p>I arrived at The Times in 1990 as a copy person and saw it as an after-school job. I had no thoughts about any
        byline, let alone writing about comics. I wish I had, because I could have reported on things like the birth of
        Image Comics or the death of Superman in 1992.</p>
      <p>In 1995, my first article appeared in The Times, but my first comic-related piece did not come until 2002. It
        was
        a lucky break. My editors were desperate to fill a shopping column. I pitched the tactic of my partner (now
        husband), who wanted me to like traveling more, and thought if I could find local comic stores to visit, I
        would.
        It worked, and that idea became “Twisted Tales of a Comic Book Connoisseur.”</p>
      <p>A DC Comics publicist, Peggy Burns, noticed that column, and when it came time to publish a story about a hate
        crime in an issue of Green Lantern, she called to see if I could write about it for the paper. I put together my
        first formal pitch to an editor, Steve Erlanger, and much to my shock, he said yes. I wrote about the comic, and
        then was surprised and delighted when the author, Judd Winick, ended up on “Phil Donahue” discussing the issue.
        It
        drove home the power of The Times to stir discussion and how these comic book characters resonate with so many
        people.</p>
      <h2>How a Comics Reporter Decides What to Cover</h2>

      <p class="image-desc">The cover of Black Panther No. 1, published in 2016 and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze. Related
        ArticleCredit...Marvel Entertainment</p>
      <p>That resonance is one of the factors that I weigh when pitching my editors stories. I start by asking myself
        three questions:</p>
      <p>Why are we reporting on this today?</p>
      <p>Is this comic company or creator doing something vastly different from others?</p>
      <p>Will the general Times audience be interested in this?</p>
      <p>Sometimes the pitch writes itself. In 2015, Marvel gave me the news that <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/books/ta-nehisi-coates-to-write-black-panther-comic-for-marvel.html?_r=0"
          alt="another article about black panther">Ta-Nehisi Coates would be writing a
          Black Panther series</a>. In this case, not only did The Times have the news first, but Black Panther was
        having
        a
        moment (the character was on the verge of making the leap into the Marvel film universe) and Mr. Coates is an
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=Ta-Nehisi%20Coates" alt="Info about the author">author that Times
          readers are interested in</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Wednesday is the day new comics are released each week, but, because of my job, I find myself reading material
        just about every day thanks to advance copies of graphic novels, creators sending me previews of their work and
        older comics I read as research (or for pleasure). Sometimes that pays off in articles on topics like <a

          alt="a ny times article about politics and comic books">how comics

      <h2>Flash Facts and Wormholes: How Comics Can Teach</h2>
      <img src="./images/FlashFactsLN-jumbo.jpg" alt="Science says you are wrong if you believe that">
      <p class="image-desc">DC Comics once ran page fillers like this one, “Science Says You’re Wrong if You Believe
        That,” with a mix of science and general information.</p>
      <p>Besides shaping a very enjoyable part of my career, comics have also taught me a lot.</p>
      <p>When I was in school, comics gave me the first inkling of topics that would be covered in depth by my teachers.
        I
        learned about the Cuban missile crisis in 1982 thanks to a Justice League time travel adventure. In 1987, an
        issue
        of the Young All-Stars, about World War II heroes, taught me about Japanese internment camps in the United
        States.
      </p>
      <p>There was also plenty of science. I know the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, thanks to the many
        “Flash
        Facts” that were in the adventures of the Flash. I also know that stationary satellites have an altitude of
        approximately 22,300 miles, thanks to the Justice League’s headquarters in space.</p>
      <p>Even today, comics continue to inform. I’m part of two comic book clubs — one conducted by email, one in real
        life. During a recent reading of Zenith, the Generation X hero created by Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell, I
        marveled at the phrase “Einstein Rosen bridge,” which elegantly described a dimensional gateway. I presumed it
        was
        made up, but another member informed me of the error of my ways: wormholes — not science fiction! (Thanks,
        Allie!)
      </p>
      <p>Today’s readers have seemingly endless options when it comes to comic books and graphics novels. There are
        series
        that slyly educate, while telling their larger story, and others that are designed specifically for learning.
        Here
        are a few of the ones I like best.</p>
      <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
      <h2>Comics That Are Slyly Educational</h2>
      <img src="./images/marvel-image-jumbo.jpg" alt="Moon Girl">
      <p class="image-desc">Kamala Khan is a teenage Muslim girl living in Jersey City. <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/books/marvel-comics-introducing-a-muslim-girl-superhero.html"
          alt="another article on ny times">Related Article</a></p>
      <p>Moon Girl — who is actually Lunella Lafayette — is a 9-year-old genius and is inspired by characters like Peter
        Parker (Spider-Man) and Tony Star (Iron Man), who are heroic and scientific. Lunella is very smart and knows it
        —
        much to the consternation of her teachers. But seeing her mature and learn to rely on others has been a joy.</p>
      <p>If the television series “My So-Called Life” had a teenager with superpowers, it would come close to the glory
        of
        Ms. Marvel, which is about Kamala Khan, a Muslim girl living in Jersey City. A great amount of care and
        attention
        is paid to Kamala’s family and balancing the immigrant experience in America: How much can you assimilate
        without
        losing your heritage? I tweet about the series often. One of my favorite moments took place in Kamala’s high
        school. The scene had a caption which read, “Imagine what would happen if compassion were normal?”</p>
      <p>Finally, there is the Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, who often uses her mind, not her fists, to solve problems. In
        her
        civilian identity as a college student, she studies computer science, which sometimes plays into her solutions
        for
        super-problems. The series is very funny and of the moment (she loves Twitter!) and always conveys a positive
        attitude.</p>
      <p>Graphic novel memoirs do a tremendous job of introducing readers to difficult and personal subjects, as schools
        all over are beginning to realize. For example:</p>
      <p>“Maus,” by Art Spiegelman, is the tale of the cartoonist’s parents and their Holocaust experience, with Jewish
        people depicted as mice and Germans as cats.</p>
      <p>“Persepolis” chronicles the life of Marjane Satrapi in Iran during its 1979 revolution and its war with Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>“Fun Home,” by Alison Bechdel, is about Ms. Bechdel’s life in rural Pennsylvania, her coming-out process, her
        obsessive-compulsive disorder and her relationship with her closeted father.</p>
      <p>Recovering from sexual abuse and struggling with anorexia are at the heart of “Lighter Than My Shadow,” by
        Katie
        Green.</p>
      <p>And “American Widow,” written by Alissa Torres and illustrated by Sungyoon Choi, is about the death of the
        author’s husband, Luis Eduardo Torres, on Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
      <h2>Comics Designed for Learning</h2>
      <img src="./images/05COMICS1-jumbo.jpg" alt="Promotional art for DC Entertainment">
      <p class="image-desc">Promotional art for DC Entertainment’s new DC Zoom imprint, which plans to introduce books

          alt="related article">Related Article</a></p>
      <p>The publisher First Second has a wonderful line of Science Comics with topics that include coral reefs, the
        brain, dogs and rockets.</p>
      <p>It also publishes “Secret Coders,” by Gene Luen Yang, where students at Stately Academy solve mysteries — and
        not-so-slyly gain basic computer programming knowledge along the way. (I’m looking forward to his “Superman
        Smashes the Klan,” which was announced as part of a DC Entertainment initiative to attract younger readers. Mr.
        Yang also addressed a “yellow peril” caricature from 1937 in the pages of his Super-Man series, which stars a
        Chinese Man of Steel.)</p>
      <p>I also recommend First Second’s Olympians series, by the cartoonist George O’Connor, who is working his way
        through 12 graphic novels that chronicle the gods and goddesses of Greece. See him in action!</p>
      <p>Having illustrations to go with text can make almost anything bearable — even user manuals and terms of
        service.
        When Google was set to introduce Chrome, it asked the cartoonist Scott McCloud to create a 38-page comic
        explaining it. (Mr. Cloud is also the author of other explanatory graphic novels: “Understanding Comics,”
        “Reinventing Comics” and “Making Comics.”) Even more ingenious is “Terms and Conditions,” the graphic novel by
        R.
        Sikoryak about the fine print in the user’s agreement for iTunes.</p>
      <p>“Manga Shakespeare” recalls the Classics Illustrated graphic novels that would adapt famous works. In this
        case,
        Manga Shakespeare offers abridged versions of the bard’s classics. (If that lure works, the next step would be
        to
        read “Kill Shakespeare,” an adventure that unites characters across all the bard’s plays in one adventure.)</p>
