    <h2>The purpose and the Scope of the Project</h2>
    <p>This project is carried out by Lucas Dans, Mathias Rønning, Umut
      Kucuk
      for the final exam of the Web Technologies lesson held by
      professor
      Fabio Vitali at the University of Bologna
      Three different article has been choosen in the fields of
      cinema, music
      and comic books.</p>

    <h2>Styles</h2>
    <h3>Modern</h3>
    <p>
      The "Modern" typographical theme represents a printed magazine with inspiration
      taken from magazines of around the latest century change. Magazines such as Vanity Fair,
      Vogue and TIME were referenced as examples of the typographical period, and as a consequence
      the final style resembles that of these magazines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color palette chosen is a simple one; black, white and red. This palette is common among
      all the referenced magazines, and an example from TIME magazine from 2000 is shown in the image
      below.

    <h3>1920s</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, new art movements were emerging in Europe. 
      The most prominent movements were Constructivism and Dadaism.
      These movements, which emerged especially after the first world war, were shaped around an anti-war mentality. 
      They criticized the destruction and barbarism of the war through art.</p>
      <p>In the 1920s, the New Objectivity (Die Neue Sachlichkeit) movement was born in Germany as a reaction against expressionism.
      This movement, which was started by George Grosz and Otto Dix and continued until the 1930s-40s, is characterized as a sarcastic and social criticism with a realistic style.
      It is difficult to say that this movement had a direct impact on style in print.
      However, the founders of the movement later signed important works in the Dadaism movement. 
      It can be said that it was a pioneering movement because it was a reaction against expressionism. </p>
      <p>Dadaism is an artistic and cultural movement that started during the First World War. 
      Dadism is against the barbarism and destruction created by the war. The rejection of the current understanding of art is its main character.
      Dada is a movement against aestheticism and finds bourgeois values disgusting. 
      It is intended to surprise and shock the public.
      Emphasizing words and even individual letters and numbers in the layout, including unusual compositions and typographic innovations are the important features of this movement.
      In this period, the grotesque font stands out as the font that represents the proletarians and the universal spirit of solidarity of the new industrial society.</p>
      <p>Another important movement of the early 20th century is De Stijl.
      It was born in the Netherlands in 1917 as a design movement. The pioneers of this movement were Theo Van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian.
      De Stijl artists explored the mathematical expression of the universe and the anatomy of nature.
      When we look at the works in modern art movements, it is seen that geometric forms are used as an indicator of science and rationality.
      This approach was taken further in De Stijl, and it was brought to form constructs consisting only of verticals and horizontals, rejecting even the use of curves and diagonals, with the thought that it reflects subjectivity.
      Designers of this movement used asymmetrical compositions in their designs; the color red, which creates a strong expression unit together with black and serif-free fonts, was used frequently.</p>
      <p>Another important movement of the 1920s, of which some characteristic features are included in the study, is the Bauhaus. Shapes, primary colors and lines are important symbols of this movement.</p>
      <p>In order to reflect the general atmosphere of the 1920s, a layout was created by being influenced by all these movements. Grotesque font is used. In order to break some lines in the text, some words are positioned vertically.
      The pictures in the study are also placed in the layout in an inclined way.
      In addition to these, some geometric shapes are included in the composition. 
      Linear borders are used in some paragraphs. 
      All these have been designed in a certain composition but with a deliberately irregular understanding. 
      In this sense, Dadaist thought and philosophy were tried to be reflected, but compositional aesthetics was not completely abandoned.
      </p>
      <h4>Color Palette and Layout</h4>
      <p>The color palette consists of light salmon, dark blue and dark red. When the magazines of the period are considered, it is striking that these color combinations are frequently used.</p>
      <div class="palette">
        <div class="color-palette1">light salmon</div>
        <div class="color-palette2">dark blue</div>
        <div class="color-palette3">dark red</div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Shocking and unexpected features are the main characteristic of Dadaism. Demonstrating individual words out of the pharagraf and the grotesque typography are also quite important for the layout.</p>

      <h3>1980s</h3>
      <p>One of the common features of journals in modern publishing in the second half of the 20th century is that a very flat and minimal understanding prevails.
        When we examine the layouts of the mainstream magazines, especially in the 80s, it is possible to encounter extremely clean, tidy and modern designs.</p>
      <p>While the modern and regular designs are also extremely impressive, a design style has been adopted based on the video game magazines published in the 80s in order to go beyond the ordinary.
        With a combination of the magical and colorful world of arcade and fun video game magazine designs, it is aimed to reveal a character that is contrary to the minimalist understanding of the mainstream publishing in 80s.</p>
        <p>VT323 font is used to create an arcade game-like design. A background consisting of a pinball table was chosen to support this layout.</p>
        <h4>Color Palette and Layout</h4>
        <p>The color palette consists of hot pink, black and white. </p>
        <div class="palette">
          <div class="color-palette4">hot pink</div>
